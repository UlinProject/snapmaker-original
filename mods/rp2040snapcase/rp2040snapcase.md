### rp2040snapcase

Addition of a miniature rp2040 microcontroller for interaction and control of additional functions via klipper firmware. The case itself is equipped with the possibility of further expansion and attachment to the beam, as well as an additional case for modifications. The screws that attach the case to the beam can be either countersunk or standard (but then they will be outside the cover). The parts can be printed on the same printer.
