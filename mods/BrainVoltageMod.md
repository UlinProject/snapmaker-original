#### Description
This procedure is necessary if you want to replace the original stepper motors with motors requiring higher currents. The image shows a detailed schematic and indicates which resistors should be used instead. I recommend using short, soft silicone wire (if you're installing a resistor or potentiometer on the wire).

<i>I've used this circuit to connect other, more interesting stepper motors (such as one with a 0.9-degree rotation angle) to the extruder. Currently, I have a simple 17HS4401S stepper motor with a 0.9-degree rotation angle, and I replaced the 4.7kΩ resistor with a 13kΩ resistor, increasing the current from ~0.5A to ~1.3A.</i>
