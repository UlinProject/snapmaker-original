### head_50mmfan

My cover design allows for the installation of a 50mm fan with minimal impact on the thermal block itself. Please note that due to the insufficient height, you will need to weld the mounting nuts to the plastic and align them so the cover closes tightly. Only then can you secure the fan with all four screws, or use just two screws without this procedure.

Make sure you don't blow directly onto the thermal block. If air leaks in, insulate it. Air should flow freely through the heatsink and the top of the thermal barrier.

Theoretically, this cover can be installed on other modules (for CNC or laser cutting), but this has not been tested.
