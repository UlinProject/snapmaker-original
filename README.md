## Description
I have been developing devices similar to 3D printers for a long time, I even created one self-assembling Cartesian printer based on a clipper (stm32f407, rails, belts) practically from scratch and one fine day, while studying a local trading platform, I came across this small and interesting printer. Initially, I was not interested in the quality of its 3D printing (I thought that if it prints, then it is already good), and I was only interested in its CNC capabilities and 3 in 1 technologies (3D, CNC, LASER).
